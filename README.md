## AYUDANTE
#### a side project aimed at creating a fully functional discord bot for ctf management; readme to be updated later. as the side project is still in-development, I decided that it would be best to set the repository as private.

## TO-DO
- [ ] CREATE A HELP MESSAGE
- [ ] change created CTF category permissions
- [ ] figure out error handling with bot commands
- [ ] rename cogs
- [ ] add functionality to get assignments from lms
- [ ] create some sort of dashboard

## DONE
- [x] set category to be private with the proper permissions, only accessed by members with certain roles.
- [x] grant entry role from reacting to bot message
- [x] successfully created and called bot commands
- [x] create a CTF category upon startup
- [x] organize functions into cogs
- [x] test git config
